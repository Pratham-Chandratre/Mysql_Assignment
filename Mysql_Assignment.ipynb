    "A database is a structured collection of data that is organized, managed, and accessed in a systematic way. It provides a means for storing, managing, retrieving, and manipulating data efficiently.\n",

    "SQL (Structured Query Language) and NoSQL (Not only SQL) are two different types of database management systems with distinct characteristics:\n",
    "\n",
    "SQL databases:\n",
    "\n",
    "SQL databases are based on a structured data model known as the relational model.\n",
    "They use tables with predefined schemas to store data, where each table consists of rows and columns.\n",
    "SQL databases enforce the use of a predefined schema, which means the data should adhere to a specific structure.\n",
    "The data in SQL databases is typically normalized to eliminate redundancy and maintain data integrity.\n",
    "SQL databases support powerful query languages like SQL, allowing complex relational queries.\n",
    "Examples of SQL databases include MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, Microsoft SQL Server.\n",
    "NoSQL databases:\n",
    "\n",
    "NoSQL databases are designed to store and retrieve unstructured or semi-structured data.\n",
    "They use flexible data models like key-value, document, column-family, or graph.\n",
    "NoSQL databases do not enforce a fixed schema, which means the data can be added or modified without adhering to a predefined structure.\n",
    "They are horizontally scalable, allowing for distributed and high-performance storage and retrieval.\n",
    "NoSQL databases excel at handling large volumes of data and high read/write workloads.\n",
    "Examples of NoSQL databases include MongoDB, Cassandra, Redis, Amazon DynamoDB.\n",
    "The choice between SQL and NoSQL databases depends on factors such as data structure, scalability requirements, performance needs, and the nature of the application. SQL databases are well-suited for structured data and complex relationships, while NoSQL databases provide flexibility, scalability, and agility for handling unstructured or rapidly changing data."

It ensures that there are no duplicate values within the key column(s) and provides a way to uniquely identify each record in the table. Typically, a Primary Key is chosen from existing columns or created using an auto-incrementing sequence. Only one Primary Key can be defined per table.\n",

Foreign Keys represent relationships between tables and are used to enforce data integrity and maintain consistency across related tables.\n",
